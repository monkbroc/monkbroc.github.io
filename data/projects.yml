      I'm the CTO & co-founder of [MuniRent](http://munirent.co).


      MuniRent is a website where local governments can rent equipment
      to each other. I put together the web application in Ruby on
      Rails, and all the DevOps that goes with hosting a multi-tenant
      cloud application.

    1000tools.com is a sharing-economy website where people can share
    tools locally. The 1000tools.com Ruby on Rails application was the

    I'm the author of
    [Send To Car for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jvanier.android.sendtocar)
    and
    [Send To Car for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/send-to-car/id623123860?mt=8)


    Send To Car is an app to send address to car navigation systems. It
    relives from the pain of having to manually enter an address in the
    aweful car navigation system interface. Instead, just search for an
    address on your phone and Send To Car will send it to the nav system
    in your car. More than a dozen brands work, all over the world.


    Send To Car has more than 100,000 downloads, more than official app
    from brands like BMW and Ford!


    The Android version is
    [free and open soure](https://github.com/monkbroc/SendToCarAndroid).
    The iOS version is $3.99.

    OpenSesame is the garage door opener app I put together for my
    house. It's a cool hack that cost me $0 of materials and has served
    me well for years now.


    The server is in node.js and the physical interface to the garage
    door opener is hacked through the flow-control pins of a RS232
    serial port. There is an Android native client with notifications
    and an HTML5/WebSocket client.


    The source for
    [the server](https://github.com/monkbroc/garage-server)
    and
    [the client](https://github.com/monkbroc/garage-client)
    is on GitHub.

    I developed engine control software for cars like the Pontiac
    Solstice for 8 years while working at Bosch in the Systems and
    Advanced Engineering group.


    The most fun projects were the ones where I was given a car and had
    to make it work by putting together an entire engine management
    system, including engine computer hardware, embedded control
    software and wiring harness.

    I love coffee!


    So when I realized that I could make better coffee by having more
    consistent water temperature in my espresso machine, I took the
    machine apart, reverse-engineered the water and AC electric
    circuits, and hooked up a PID controller, a solid-state relay and a
    thermocouple to add digital temperature control!


    Everything fit back inside the box when I was done, so my espresso
    machine doesn't look like a bomb anymore.
